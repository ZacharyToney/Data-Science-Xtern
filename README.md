Analyzing a data set

Clearly these coordinates are off the west coast of Africa in the Gulf of Guinea. 
It appears to be two large clumps of users two different sets of users. 
There's a point in the set of data where it switches from user 43 to 99 that's when to goes from the clump closest to shore to the
one further out. Unfortunately I ran out of time to analyze the trends of the timestamps themselves.
